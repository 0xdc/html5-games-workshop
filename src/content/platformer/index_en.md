We are going to create a classic **one-screen platformer** game! It will feature a main character, who can run and jump to platforms. There will also be enemies that this character will have to avoid â€“or kill! The goal of the game is to fetch the key and open the door that leads to the next level.

We will be implementing the following game development concepts:

- **Loading** assets.
- Handling **game states**.
- Rendering **images** on the screen.
- Implementing **sprites**.
- Reading the player's input via **keyboard**.
- Using a **physics engine** to move sprites and handle **collisions**.
- Writing **text** with a bitmap font.
- Playing **sound** effects and background music.

We will focus on game development concepts and the Phaser API in a way that is accessible to as many people as possible. This means that some good practises, like modules, that require of additional tools or a better understanding of JavaScript will _not_ be seen here.

That said, if _you_ are familiar with this tools/concepts and want to use them in this workshop, by all means, do it.
